msgid ""
"Fix Image Rotation plugin fixes image orientation based on EXIF data.  This "
"is primarily a patch for mis-oriented images delivered from iPhones.  "
"Functionally it filters all uploads and if EXIF->Orientation is set to a "
"number greater than 1, then the image is resaved with a new orientation "
"before the image is processed by WordPress."
