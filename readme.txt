Fixes the rotation of the images based on EXIF data

== Description ==
Fix Image Rotation plugin fixes image orientation based on EXIF data. Fixes the mis-oriented images clicked via mobile phones. 

Functionally it filters all uploads and if EXIF->Orientation is set to a number greater than 1, then the image is re-saved with a new orientation before the image is processed by WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How it works? = 
When an image is clicked by a camera or a phone, it stores some additional information about the image. One such information is Orientation. This plugin makes use of the Orientation value stored by the camera/phone and rotates or flips the image based on that.

= Where's the settings page? =
This plugin works out of the box and does not require any settings.
